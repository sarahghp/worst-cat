## Welcome to Worst Cat

This is an experiment in creating a WebGL vBuffer, a diffing engine for WebGL projects, inspired by vDOMs. This code now exists mostly as supplementary material to my Strangeloop 2017 talk, _Adventures in the vBuffer_.

Different variations of the project exist in a number of branches: vanilla JS, Immutable.js, Clojurescript, and the original Lodashâ€“supported implementation. Clone and run to see the performance implications of each choice.

The name is in homage to [this wonderful Tumblr](http://worstcats.tumblr.com/).
